## Problem description
The transport sector is responsible for 30% of total CO2 emissions in Europe, of which 72% is produced by road transport alone. In an effort to limit CO2 emissions, the EU has set a target of reducing transport emissions by 60% from 1990 levels by 2030.
Car traffic is a major cause of air pollution, understood as changes in the air brought about by emissions of gases, particulate matter and fumes, which are extremely harmful to human health.
Although the introduction of more inflexible legislation has resulted in significant improvements in air quality over time compared to past decades, nevertheless, hazardous pollutant emissions continue to be traced mainly to cars.
Pollution from motor vehicles is mainly attributed to the exhaust gases they produce through driving, particularly through the production of particulate matter and, in the case of vehicles with heat engines, through the fumes emitted from the tailpipe.
The European Union has categorized the various engines according to their CO2 emissions: Euro0, Euro1, Euro2, Euro3, Euro4, Euro5, Euro6.
The "Eco-mobility" initiative was created with the aim of solving the above-mentioned problem of air pollution due to CO2 emissions from personal transportation vehicles.
